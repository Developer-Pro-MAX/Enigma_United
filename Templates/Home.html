            <H3> Welcome To The Ultimate Tool For Making Our Words And Classified Documents Unreadable For All Others </h3>
              <br>
            <h5> This is an initiative by the NSC and CDF to enable us with the technology to safely encrypt our messages which hold secrecy to the level of self respect and to safeguard our thoughts and words which otherwise if made way into other people's hand might hurt the self interest of ours. This is a fully functional AES framework based Encryption system and it will be offered further to our near and dear close people with whom we'll ever wonder how to communicate easily, this is such a beautiful and powerful piece of technology that now we can safely keep our views and words in front of the world and nobody will ever be able to even imagine or understand that the deep secrets lie in front of them, we plan to integrate this system with an AI based system that keeps changing the encryption key. So basically in whole world only this software can decrypt the messages I create and only if you have the right encryption key. Also there are other security features which we have integrated to prevent further mishaps, and a hint is - don't b +, remove b! So let's start towards a safer alternative to randomly ranting on word documents and fearing what if someone reads them xD
